# AI-driven-fertilizer-usage-optimi# ðŸŒ± AI-Driven Sustainable Fertilizer Usage Optimizer

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project uses Machine Learning to recommend the **best fertilizer** based on soil nutrients (NPK), soil type, crop type, temperature, humidity, and moisture.  
The goal is to promote **sustainable agriculture** and **higher yields** by optimizing fertilizer usage.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- Source: Kaggle (Fertilizer Recommendation Dataset â€“ Ismail Saleem)  
- File used: `data_core_updated.csv`  
- Features:
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Soil Moisture
  - Soil Type
  - Crop Type
  - Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium (NPK)
- Target:
  - Fertilizer type (e.g., Urea, MOP, DAP, etc.)

---

## ðŸ”Ž Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Histograms for numeric features (NPK, temperature, humidity, soil moisture)  
- Correlation heatmap for feature relationships  
- Fertilizer type distribution  

---

## ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Models
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Random Forest Classifier (chosen due to higher accuracy)  

### Accuracy
Random Forest achieved better performance compared to Decision Tree.

## ðŸ”® Prediction Demo
Example custom input:
```python
Temperature = 28
Humidity = 65
Soil Moisture = 55
Soil Type = Loamy
Crop Type = Wheat
Nitrogen = 90
Phosphorus = 30
Potassium = 40
